\begin{abstract}
  A complex web of relationships provides goods for manufacturing, assembling and delivering of final products known as supply chain. Emerging technologies have been used in supply chain systems in order to provide traceability. However, these systems tend to be centralized, monopolistic, asymmetric and opaque. As a consequence, these systems may result in trusting problems, such as fraud, corruption and tampering. Blockchain technology provides a new approach for information systems based on decentralization, that can apply for these supply chain systems. This work presents a Blockchain-based platform for developing applications that provide such traceability for the supply chain management.
