\section{Conclusion} \label{sec:Conclusion}

Although, some companies have launched pilot projects using Blockchain technology to manage their supply chains, no detailed information on the technical implementation of such projects has been reported. Either way, the retail industry has the potential to use this technology to improve traceability.  Even if some properties of Blockchain implementation may be useful for supply chain management, there are still a few uses to support this claim. 

In this paper, we proposed a framework for new decentralized traceability systems based on Blockchain technology. This system will deliver online information to all supply chain members on the safety status of goods, providing a more secure, distributed, transparent, and collaborative approach to supply chain management. The framework can significantly improve the development time of Supply Chain Management applications, and provide efficiency and transparency for product management on a supply chain. In a future work, we will present a proof of concept that exercises the use of proposed framework.
